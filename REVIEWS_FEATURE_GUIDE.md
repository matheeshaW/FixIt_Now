# Reviews Feature Implementation Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Backend
1. **Review Entity** (`Review.java`) - Maps to `reviews` table
2. **ReviewRepository** - JPA repository with custom queries
3. **ReviewService** - Business logic for review operations
4. **ReviewController** - REST API endpoints
5. **Security Configuration** - Added reviews endpoints to allowed routes

### Frontend
1. **ProviderReviews Component** - New component for displaying provider reviews
2. **Provider Dashboard Integration** - Added "Reviews" tab to provider dashboard
3. **Review Pages** - AddReviewPage, ProviderReviewsPage, CustomerReviewsPage
4. **API Integration** - Added review API calls to services/api.js

## 🔧 API Endpoints

- `POST /api/reviews` - Add a new review (requires completed booking)
- `GET /api/reviews/provider/{providerId}` - Get reviews for a provider
- `GET /api/reviews/customer/{customerId}` - Get reviews by a customer
- `GET /api/reviews` - Get all reviews (Admin)

## 🎯 How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

#### For Customers:
1. Login as a customer
2. Go to Customer Dashboard
3. Go to "My Bookings" tab

5. Click "Add Review" button
6. Fill out the review form and submit

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Missing booking, provider, or customer ID" error**
   - Make sure you're using the "Add Review" button from completed bookings
   - Don't navigate directly to `/reviews/add`

2. **"Authentication required" error**
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Check if the JWT token is valid

3. **"Review can only be added when booking is completed" error**
   - Only completed bookings can be reviewed
   - Change booking status to COMPLETED first

4. **No reviews showing in Provider Dashboard**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the provider ID is being extracted correctly from JWT token
   - Check if reviews exist in the database

## 📊 Database Schema

The reviews table has the following structure:
- `review_id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to bookings)
- `customer_id` (Foreign Key to users)
- `provider_id` (Foreign Key to users)
